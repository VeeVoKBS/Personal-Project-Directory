# App Flow Document for Personal Project Directory

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new user visits the Personal Project Directory website or opens the mobile app, they land on a clean, minimal landing page that showcases sample project galleries and invites them to sign in with Google. A prominent button labeled “Sign in with Google” initiates the Google OAuth flow. Users are redirected to Google’s secure consent screen where they approve permissions. Once they complete authentication, they are returned to the app and automatically see their own dashboard. There is no manual password or email signup. If a user ever loses access, they recover their account by managing access through their Google account settings. To sign out, the user clicks the profile icon and selects “Sign Out,” which ends the session and returns them to the landing page. On mobile, the same steps occur inside the React Native/Expo app, with the device’s native Google login screen appearing for authentication.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After signing in, the user sees their main dashboard. At the top is a header with the app logo on the left, a global search bar in the center for finding other users, and a profile menu on the right. Along the left side is a collapsible navigation panel that includes links to Projects, Social Integrations, Settings, and Upgrade. The central area displays the user’s project gallery in a Notion-inspired grid layout. Free users see default styling with placeholder cards if no projects exist. Paid users see an additional toolbar above the gallery for customization actions. On both web and mobile, tapping on any project card navigates to the project edit or detail page. A floating “Add Project” button at the bottom right opens the project creation form.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When the user clicks “Add Project,” they arrive at the project form page where they enter the title, description, tags, cover image, additional images or videos, technologies used, live link, repository link, status, and an optional highlight section. Upon saving, the app returns them to the dashboard and displays the new project card instantly. Editing any existing project follows the same form flow, pre-populated with current data, and saving updates the gallery immediately.

To connect social accounts, the user navigates to the Social Integrations page via the sidebar. They click each platform’s “Connect” button to go through LinkedIn, GitHub, or Twitter OAuth flows. After granting permissions, the app stores the API credentials in Supabase and begins fetching likes, comments, stars, forks, retweets, and replies. These metrics appear as small icons on each project card and refresh automatically every 24 hours. If an integration fails, the user sees an error banner and can retry the connection.

Upgrading to a paid plan happens when the user selects “Upgrade” in the sidebar. They view monthly and annual pricing on a Stripe-powered checkout page. After successful payment, the app unlocks advanced features and removes all ads. Paid users can then open the customization editor by clicking “Customize” above the gallery. Within this editor, they drag and drop blocks, adjust grid settings, swap fonts and colors, and edit text inline. Every change shows in a live preview. The Design Catalog is accessible via a tab in the editor, where users browse and preview templates before applying them to their directory or individual project pages.

Premium users can also summon the AI Design Assistant from the customization toolbar. A modal collects their style preferences, such as cold-toned palette or minimal layout, and any sample images. When they confirm, the assistant returns a JSON layout recommendation, rewritten text suggestions, and styling rules. Users apply these suggestions with a single click, instantly transforming the look of their pages.

For visitors exploring directories, anyone can use the global search in the header to find users by name. Entering a query shows matching usernames. Clicking a result navigates to the public profile at `/username`, where all published projects appear in gallery form with up-to-date engagement metrics. Visitors can click a project to view its detailed public page. Portfolio owners can also share a QR code from their dashboard or print it on business cards, allowing others to scan and open their profile instantly in web or mobile.

## Settings and Account Management
In the Settings section, users manage their personal information such as display name, profile picture, and bio. They toggle notification preferences for project comments, social metric updates, and subscription reminders. Billing details and subscription status appear in a dedicated Billing tab, where users can view invoices, change plans, or cancel their subscription. Automated emails for welcome messages, subscription renewals, and other notifications are sent via Supabase’s email service or an integrated provider like SendGrid. From any settings page, users click “Back to Dashboard” to return to the main view.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If Google OAuth fails or the user cancels consent, an error message appears on the landing page prompting them to retry. During project creation or editing, if required fields are missing or file uploads fail, inline validation highlights the issue with a brief message and a retry option. When social API calls hit rate limits or fail, the app shows a banner on the Social Integrations page explaining the error and offering a retry button. In the customization editor, if the AI assistant cannot generate recommendations, a fallback message suggests manual edits. Payment errors on Stripe display the error reason and invite the user to update their card. Network connectivity issues trigger a full-screen offline notice with a retry button. In all cases, once the issue is resolved, users return seamlessly to their previous page without losing unsaved work.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
The typical user journey begins with a quick Google sign-in and leads to an empty gallery that evolves into a personalized portfolio as they add projects. Connecting social accounts enriches their pages with real metrics, while free and paid tiers let them choose between simplicity and full customization. The AI Design Assistant and Design Catalog guide even non-designers toward polished results. Visitors discover directories via search or QR scan and engage with project galleries effortlessly. All of this happens across web and mobile, backed by Supabase, Next.js, React Native, and Stripe, ensuring a smooth end-to-end experience from sign-up to sharing a professional project showcase.
