Project Charter

Project Name: Personal Project Directory

1. Project Summary

The Personal Project Directory is a web-based and mobile platform where users can create an account with their Google Account, upload and showcase their projects, and connect with major platforms (LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter) to display engagement metrics.

The platform provides a clean, minimal directory inspired by Notion‚Äôs gallery design. Free users get a default layout, while paid users unlock customization features for both their directory page and individual project pages. An AI-powered design assistant and design catalog further enhance customization, making it easier for users to create visually appealing and personalized project showcases.

The platform also includes monetization features such as ads, subscriptions, and premium tiers to ensure sustainability and provide advanced user features.
