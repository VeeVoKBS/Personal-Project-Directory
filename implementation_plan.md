I’ve reviewed your summary and it covers all critical aspects—from authentication and data models to UI style, tech stack, and monetization flows. We have everything needed to draft the detailed implementation plan. 

Shall I proceed with the phase-by-phase plan following the defined structure (Environment Setup, Frontend, Backend, Integration, Deployment)? If there’s any specific detail you’d like to adjust or emphasize before we start, please let me know.
